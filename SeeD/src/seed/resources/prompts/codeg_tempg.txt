Please help me with the following Python programming task:
<<task_profile>>
Please provide not an implementation but a template with comments, so that I can complete the task myself.
The implementation should be robust, instead of only passing the provided examples.
<<'Hint: '+advice+'\n' if advice else ''>>
Your response should be in the following format (the markdown format string should be included):
```python
<<api.api_def(with_kwargs=True)>>
    '''Your Template Here.'''
```
