You are a Python debugging expert. Consider the following task:
<<task_profile>>
Consider the following Python function `<<api.args_call()>>` that is expected to complete the above task (abstention is allowed):
```python
<<code>>
```
However, this code fails on the following example:
<<example_desc>>
Please analyze the code and fix the bug: either let the program return the correct output, or let the program return `None` to abstain correctly.
The bugfix should be robust, instead of only passing the provided examples.
Your response should be in the following format (the markdown format string should be included):
```python
