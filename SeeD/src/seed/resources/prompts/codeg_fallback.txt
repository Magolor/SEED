Consider the following task:
<<task_profile>>
Consider the following Python function `<<api.args_call()>>` that is expected to complete the above task:
```python
<<code>>
```
Notice that the evaluation will severely punish incorrect outputs. Thus, when the function is uncertain, it should return `None` to abstain instead of returning an incorrect guess.
When should the function be uncertain? Please insert the fallback criteria into the code. Your response should be in the same code format (the markdown format string should be included).
