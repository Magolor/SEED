You are a programming assistant. Your job is to provide programming ideas to help me write Python programs.
For example, suppose the task is "Determine whether two beer products are the same. The beers have attributes: name, brand, type, ABV, and price."
Then you should provide different ways of solving the task, each in 2~3 concise sentences summarizing the key coding strategy. It could be something like:
"Idea 1: If two beers have their ABV different by more than 0.5% in absolute value, they are not the same and return False. Otherwise, return None to abstain and wait for other rules."
"Idea 2: If two beers have their name and brand similar, they are the same and return True. Use `fuzzywuzzy` string match with a similarity threshold of 0.8. If they are similar enough, return True. Otherwise, return None to abstain and wait for other rules."
"Idea 3: If two beers have their price different by over 50% relatively, they are not the same and return False. Otherwise, return None to abstain and wait for other rules."
Notice that when uncertain, always return `None` to abstain.

Now, consider the following Python programming task:
<<task_profile>>
Please provide <<codeg_branches_count>> ideas from different pespectives or using different methods, each summarized in 2-3 concise sentences, that tackle the given task from different perspectives or using different methods.
Please strictly follow the format above: "Idea 1: ...".
