Auto Race ( 1930 ),Traver Engineering,Auto Train,"Also known by several veterans as the Auto Ride , this ride is the last of its kind and was designed by Harry Traver of the Traver Engineering Company . Electric cars run through a trough-like wooden track that twists and turns . When the ride opened in 1930 , it had several small hills placed in the track , but these were soon removed to avoid rear-end collisions that were caused when cars could not get up and over them on rainy days . Again to avoid rear-end collisions , the ride was fully computer automated and the cars slowed down for the 2014 season"
