Name,Area,Year,Notes
Brighton Road,Southgate,2009,"This area consists of Victorian and Edwardian buildings immediately south of the level crossing where the Arun Valley Line meets the London-Brighton road . Large houses and commercial buildings of various types , mostly of brown and red brick and some with elements of the Classical style , are typical . Modern buildings , refronted shop units and ill-defined areas of car parking are considered to affect the area 's appearance , though"
Dyers Almshouses,Northgate,1996,"This group of 30 architecturally distinctive almshouses are one of many works by local building firm Longley and Company . Built in three phases between 1939 and 1971 , they combine the Arts and Crafts style with elements reminiscent of rural Dutch cottage [ s ] . Large tile-hung gables , stock brick and intricate tall chimneys are prominent features . The houses were built for the Worshipful Company of Dyers , a London Livery Company"
Forestfield and Shrublands,Furnace Green,1996,"Architects Phippen Randall Parkes designed these two small and distinctive estates between 1965 and 1971 . Shrublands was completed first , in 1968 , and its design was based on suggestions made by members of the housing association for which it was built . These future residents were asked questions based on sociological theory . Open space was planned as an integral part of each estate , and the relationship between the houses and their surroundings ( in particular the nearby ancient woodland of Tilgate Forest ) is important . Forestfield has 125 houses in five equally sized clusters ; Shrublands has 71 in a more informal layout . Both estates won design awards"
Hazelwick Road,Three Bridges,2013,"After Three Bridges railway station became a junction in the 1840s , the village of Three Bridges to the east of Crawley grew in importance . Fields were developed with terraced and semi-detached houses and some larger villas ; Hazelwick Road , dating from the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th , is an example of higher-class housing alongside the smaller accommodation for railway workers . Features include bay windows , brickwork in various colours and original sash windows"
High Street,Town Centre,1986,"The High Street and its buildings have been renewed and reconstructed regularly over the centuries , but it has always been of central importance to the town . The street widens halfway along , but no trace remains of the buildings that once occupied a central island . Some houses became coaching inns when coach traffic thrived , and hotels or restaurants after it declined ; others are now shops . Purpose-built shops such as Grand Parade followed in the 20th century . Several medieval hall houses survive"
Ifield Village,Ifield,1981,"The conservation area covers what was originally the central settlement in the large rural parish of Ifield , around the 13th-century St Margaret 's Church ( a replacement for a pre- Norman building ) . Many of the surrounding buildings are nationally or locally listed : the vicarage , the former school , the current and former Plough Inns , a house associated with Elizabeth Fry , and a 17th-century barn and granary which have been converted into a theatre . The village green , which retains an old boundary stone , is also within the conservation area"
Langley Lane ( † ),Ifield,2013,"This long lane , no more than a tree-lined cul-de-sac , was built up from the 15th century and has buildings from that era to the present . The Grade I-listed Ifield Friends Meeting House ( pictured ) is 17th-century , and other listed buildings include Apple Tree Farm ( at which substantial residential development took place in the early 21st century ) , Langley Grange , Finches Cottage and Old Inn Cottage . The lane forms an eastward extension to the Ifield Village conservation area"
Malthouse Road,Southgate,2013,"The building firm James Longley and Company was based in the vicinity of this road , and it was responsible for most of the terraced cottages , semi-detached houses , detached houses and large villas which still characterise it . The street curves from north to west , following ancient field boundaries . Development started in 1899 . The five semi-detached villas at numbers 108-122 ( pictured ) have locally listed status"
St Peter 's,West Green,1996,"The hamlet of West Green was named by 1532 . Housing development in the second half of the 19th century caused it to merge with Crawley town centre to the east , and the growth prompted the opening of the spacious sandstone -built St Peter 's Church in 1893 . This forms the centre of the present conservation area . Brick cottages with contrasting quoins , porches and bargeboards are typical , and many open out straight on to the narrow streets . The area also has a commercial feel : some houses now have shop units at ground-floor level . Two pubs ( including the locally listed Swan Inn ) and a range of old trees enhance the area"
Southgate Neighbourhood Centre,Southgate,2013,"Each New Town neighbourhood centre had the same general set of buildings - a church , pub , shopping parade and a community centre . The planners tried to vary their designs and grouping as much as possible ; the mid-1950s shops at Wakehams Drive in Southgate take the form of an arcade with flats above , and St Mary 's Church ( 1958 ) is a striking concrete and glass Modernist building with a large metal spire and a tunnel-vaulted roof . The council describes it as one of the most successful neighbourhood centres"
Sunnymead Flats,West Green,1997,"Inspired by the Festival of Britain in 1951 and some contemporary flats in Stockholm , these six .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps { font-variant : small-caps } .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller { font-size:85% } y -shaped blocks of three-storey flats are built of brightly painted rendered concrete and were erected to house the builders who were working on early New Town residential developments . They are set in lawned grounds with trees and shrubs"
West Street ( † ),Southgate,2013,"Like the Brighton Road area , of which this proposed conservation area forms a westward extension , West Street developed in the late Victorian era . Terraced and semi-detached houses with multicoloured brickwork are typical of the street . The extension would stretch into part of Springfield Road , whose houses are larger and have features such as sash windows and bargeboards"
Worth,Worth,1987,"The centrepiece of the conservation area , the ancient village and its vast parish is one of the most powerful of Anglo-Saxon churches , St Nicholas ' ( pictured ) . Other than a tower added in 1871 by Anthony Salvin , little has changed for 1000 years . The ancient Forest of Worth spread across southern Surrey and northern Sussex , and ancient trees ( some protected by TPOs ) are important in the conservation area . The former rectory and a former toll house are among the other important buildings"
