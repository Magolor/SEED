Möhne Reservoir,Ruhr,Germany,Destroyed during WWII by RAF Lancaster bombers during Operation Chastise . 5.1 MW capacity lost for about six weeks,1943
Edersee Dam,Waldeck-Frankenberg,Germany,Destroyed during WWII by RAF Lancaster bombers during Operation Chastise . 16 MWe of generation lost,1943
Schoellkopf Power Station,"Niagara Falls , New York",United States,"Destruction of the plant as it fell from the Niagara Gorge wall and collapsed into the Niagara River , caused by water seeping into the back wall of the power station . One worker was killed and damage was estimated at US $ 100 million ( or $ 940 million today , adjusted for inflation )",1956
Vajont Dam,Pordenone,Italy,"Overtopping due to landslide caused by instability of the rock around , with the evidence of the instability suppressed by the Government . 1,917 deaths",1963
Mangla Dam,Kashmir,Pakistan,The power house was damaged due to an Indian Air Force raid during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 . The 1000 MW hydro project was temporarily out of service,1971
Banqiao Dam,Henan,China,"26,000 dead from flooding , 145,000 dead from subsequent famine and epidemics , 11 million homeless . Caused loss of generation , dam failed by overtopping in a 1-in-2,000 year flood",1975
Teton Dam,Idaho,United States,"The dam foundations washed away and a wave swept aside everything in its path , including two towns , killing at least eleven people , and thousands of cattle",1976
Machchhu Dam,Machchhu,India,"The Machhu Dam-II collapsed , leading to the deluge of the city of Morbi and the surrounding rural areas . 1800-25,000 people were killed",1979
Lawn Lake Dam,Colorado,United States,"Failed in fair weather due to a combination of poor construction , age , and neglect . Caused downstream failure of the Cascade Dam . Destroyed historical Stanley hydro power station and a fish hatchery . Flooded a campground and the town of Estes Park impacting 75% of business activity . $ 31 million in damages and three lives lost . Three similar dams in the region were subsequently demolished",1982
Dartmouth Dam,Victoria,Australia,"The 180MW Francis turbine-generator running at full speed was instantaneously stopped by a foreign body left in the penstock following maintenance . [ 7 ] The installation shifted about 2m within the base of the 180m high earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906GL reservoir . After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall ( declared safe after lengthy assessment ) , the hydro installation was repaired/replaced but was off-line for several years . A breach of the wall would have obliterated only a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120 km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam , but more significantly , would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the 40m high 3,038GL Lake Hume , 200 km downstream on the Murray River . This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga and a much more intensively settled irrigation area , and consequences would have been disastrous",1990
Srisailam Dam,Andhra Pradesh,India,"Due to poor reservoir operation , flood water overflowed into the semi underground power house ( 770 MW ) from the point where a protection wall was to be constructed before power house commissioning in 1987 . Flood water deluge caused the complete submergence of power house , massive debris accumulation , electrical equipment replacement and loss of power generation for a year",1998
Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station,Valais,Switzerland,"1269 MW loss , penstock rupture , three fatalities , flooding and loss of generating capacity",2000
Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station,Missouri,United States,"Due to its being designed without a spillway and continuing to operate when management knew the gauging system was faulty , the upper reservoir was overtopped when water continued to be pumped from the lower reservoir after the upper was already full . A large section of the upper reservoir failed , draining over a billion gallons of water ( 4 million m³ ) in less than half an hour . There were no fatalities , but five people were injured . The failure resulted in permanent damage to the surrounding landscape and power generation did not resume until 2010",2005
Itaipu Dam,Paraná ( BR ) Alto Paraná ( PY ),Brazil Paraguay,18 GW power generation loss due to storm damage of transmission lines,2009
Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam,Khakassia,Russia,"2009 Sayano-Shushenskaya hydro accident , 6 GW power generation loss , 75 fatalities , due to turbine failure",2009
Srisailam Dam,Andhra Pradesh,India,"On 2 October 2009 , an earth dam burst above the Srisailam reservoir creating a record inflow which threatened the dam",2009
Vishnuprayag hydro electric station ( 400 MW ),Uttarakhand,India,Flash floods resulted in accumulation of huge quantity of muck and debris in the dam reservoir,2013
Dhauliganga hydro electric station ( 280 MW ),Uttarakhand,India,"Unprecedented flash floods in June , 2013 in the State of Uttarakhand causing the complete submergence of power house . Massive debris accumulation , electrical equipment replacement and loss of total generation capacity for more than six months",2013
Uri-II Power Station ( 240 MW ),Jammu and Kashmir,India,A large fire incident happened in one of the transformers of the power station,2014
Oroville Dam,California,United States,"Damaged spillway caused evacuation of 180,000",2017
