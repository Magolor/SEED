"August 19 , 1971",Santa Martha Acatitla,Mexico,Yes,Joel David Kaplan Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro,"Joel David Kaplan was a New York businessman and nephew of molasses tycoon Jacob Merrill Kaplan .

In May 1961 , the ruler of the Dominican Republic , Rafael Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA . The CIA described its role in changing the government of the Dominican Republic as a 'success ' in that it assisted in moving the Dominican Republic from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy . In November 1961 , Mexican police found a corpse they identified as Luis Melchior Vidal , Jr. , godson of Trujillo . Vidal was the unofficial business agent of the Dominican Republic while Trujillo was in power . Under cover of the American Sucrose Company and the Paint Company of America , Vidal had teamed up with the American , Joel David Kaplan , to operate as arms merchants for the CIA . In 1962 , the younger Kaplan was convicted of killing Vidal , in Mexico City . Kaplan was held at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in the Iztapalapa borough of the Mexico City D.F . region . Joel 's sister , Judy Kaplan , attempted to secure his release in numerous ways , finally developing an audacious plot . On August 19 , 1971 , a helicopter landed in the prison yard .

In two minutes , Kaplan and Kaplan 's cellmate Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro , a Venezuelan counterfeiter , boarded the craft and were piloted away . No shots were fired . Both men were flown to Texas and then different planes flew Kaplan to California and Castro to Guatemala . The Mexican government never initiated extradition proceedings against Kaplan . The escape is told in a book , The 10-Second Jailbreak : The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan .
