Name,Years,Education,College as professor,Notes
John Bainbridge,1620 or 1621 - 1643,University of Cambridge ( Emmanuel College ),Merton College,"Bainbridge practised as a physician in Leicestershire and London after leaving Cambridge . His first book , An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet , was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year . He was already known by this time to Sir Henry Savile and Henry Briggs ( who Savile appointed as his first geometry professor ) . After his appointment to the chair , Bainbridge also lectured and practised in medicine . Although only a few other publications of his survive , they have been said to reveal an acute intellect and deep learning . He demonstrated a knowledge of contemporary developments in astronomy , such as the work of Johannes Kepler , and studied Arabic to acquire details of astronomical observations in ancient sources . He also exposed the many mistakes that Joseph Scaliger made when attempting to explain the origins of the Julian calendar in observations of Sirius from ancient Egypt - an achievement that was recorded by his successor John Greaves on his memorial in Merton College Chapel"
John Greaves,1643-48,Balliol College,Merton College,"Greaves began studying astronomical texts in Greek , Arabic and Persian at about the time that he was appointed to a fellowship of Merton College in 1624 . He was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1631 . He undertook an expedition to the Levant region of the Mediterranean in 1637 to carry out astronomical observations and to acquire learned books in oriental languages for William Laud ( Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury ) . Some of the instruments he took with him are now held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford . He returned home in 1640 , and succeeded Bainbridge in 1643 . During the English Civil War , he was expelled from Oxford by the Parliamentary authorities in charge of the university in 1648 , and moved to London , where he published various works drawing upon the research carried out in his expedition . He was a friend of Seth Ward and was able to help him succeed to the chair that he had been forced to vacate"
Seth Ward,1649-60,University of Cambridge ( Sidney Sussex College ),Wadham College and Trinity College,"When still an undergraduate , Ward impressed John Bainbridge ( the first astronomy professor ) during a mathematical disputation . Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643 , but was deprived of his fellowship in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the Parliamentary authorities . He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge , before succeeding his friend John Greaves in the Savilian chair , with Greaves 's assistance . University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward , who was the first Savilian professor to teach the Copernican discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun . He studied comets and the movements of the planets , observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived ; he also preached and published theological works . He was elected Principal of Jesus College , Oxford , in 1657 , but Oliver Cromwell installed Francis Howell instead , raising Ward 's stipend as compensation . He was President of Trinity College , Oxford , from 1659 but resigned 1660 at The Restoration in favour of his ejected predecessor ; he also gave up the professorship in the same year . He later became Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury , where he did much to restore the cathedrals , but did not continue his astronomical studies"
Christopher Wren,1661-73,Wadham College,All Souls College,"As an undergraduate , Wren joined the circle of mathematicians and natural scientists at Wadham under the leadership of the Warden , John Wilkins . He developed an interest for telescopes and astronomy , building with Wilkins an 80-foot ( 24 m ) long instrument to observe the Moon in 1655 . Oliver Cromwell appointed Wren in 1657 as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , on the recommendation of Wilkins ; Wren lectured on Saturn ( the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied ) , Kepler 's works , light , and lenses . He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by Blaise Pascal , the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits . He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair , lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation . He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies , with early work including the chapel of Pembroke College , Cambridge , and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford . His architectural skills led to his role in rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 ( including St Paul 's Cathedral ) and his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 . Isaac Newton described him as one of the foremost geometers of this age . Wren appointed Edward Bernard as his deputy in the chair in 1669 , on his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works , and Bernard succeeded him four years later"
Edward Bernard,1673-91,St John 's College,St John 's College,"Bernard studied Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac and Coptic with Edward Pococke ( Laudian Professor of Arabic at the university ) and mathematics with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . When Christopher Wren was appointed as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 , he appointed Bernard as his deputy in the astronomy chair ; he succeeded Wren in 1673 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the same day . Bernard 's interests , as demonstrated in his lectures , were more in ancient mathematics and astronomy than in modern developments ; he published comparatively few works . Tiring of his academic duties , he moved to Paris to tutor two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II , the Duke of Grafton and the Duke of Northumberland , but returned after falling out with their mother , the King 's mistress . He unsuccessfully sought other positions abroad , including the chair of Arabic at the University of Leiden . He resigned in 1691 when appointed to a lucrative parish position as rector of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell near Oxford"
David Gregory,1691-1708,"Marischal College and University of Aberdeen , and Leiden University",Balliol College,"Gregory studied in his native Scotland and befriended the Edinburgh physician Archibald Pitcairne before travelling through Europe and continuing his education . He inherited the papers of his uncle James Gregory , a mathematician and astronomer , which he studied carefully . He succeeded his uncle at the University of Edinburgh in 1683 , giving a history of the progress of mathematics as his inaugural lecture . In 1690 , Gregory refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime of William III and Mary II but was not removed from his post . He enlisted the support of Isaac Newton and John Flamsteed , the Astronomer Royal , in his efforts to obtain the Oxford chair , and was elected in December 1691 , becoming a Fellow of Balliol and obtaining an Oxford doctorate in February 1692 . As professor , he lectured less often than required by the terms of his appointment , and covered only relatively uncomplicated material rather than Newton 's work . He moved to London in 1704 and was appointed overseer of the Scottish Mint in 1707 to supervise recoinage in Scotland . He died in 1708 . He has been described as not a notable observational astronomer , but instead a talented correspondent , communicator and teacher"
John Caswell,1709-12,Wadham College,Hart Hall,"Carswell matriculated at Wadham College , Oxford , when he was 16 years old , and studied with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . He worked with the cartographer John Adams on the survey of England and Wales that Adams began in the late 17th century . He was also vice-principal of Hart Hall , and wrote a book on trigonometry"
John Keill,1712-21,University of Edinburgh and Balliol College,Balliol College,"Keill studied in Edinburgh with David Gregory and moved to Balliol with him in 1691 when Gregory was appointed as the Savilian astronomy professor . An accomplished pupil of Gregory , Keill was the first to teach a course on Newtonian principles at Oxford or Cambridge , lecturing in experimental philosophy at Hart Hall . He began deputising for Thomas Millington ( Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy ) in 1699 but after Millington died in 1704 Keill was not appointed as his successor , nor were his hopes of succeeding Gregory realised . After serving in various government roles , including decipherer to Queen Anne , he was elected to succeed Carswell . Described as one of the most influential natural philosophers in Britain for his work on Newtonian principles . he was one of the first to suggest that there might be attractions between invisible particules within matter that caused states such as elasticity and fluidity . His publications included his lectures on astronomy"
James Bradley,1721-62,Balliol College,-,"Bradley was the nephew of James Pound , a leading astronomer who was a colleague of Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton , and helped his uncle with his observations near London even when Bradley was appointed as vicar of a church in Monmouthshire . He had a particular interest in the moons of Jupiter , correcting errors in published astronomical tables , Mars and nebulae , and was highly regarded by Halley . Bradley resigned as a clergyman on appointment to the chair in 1721 . His major discovery , in 1725 , was the aberration of light , in which stars appeared to move position as the earth moved , which led him to be able to calculate the speed of light and the time it took to travel from the Sun to the Earth . He moved to the Savilian professors ' house in 1732 , and succeeded Halley as Astronomer Royal in 1742 , improving the state of the buildings and instruments at the Greenwich observatory . His continued observations on the positions of the stars ( to help with navigation ) , the moon , and comets led to the discovery of nutation : the nodding of the Earth on its axis as it travelled around the Sun . He recorded observations for 18 years to measure the phenomenon , which helped to show ( as Newton argued ) that the earth was flatter at the poles . He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for this work . He carried on his astronomical observations , receiving many honours from home and abroad , until his death in 1762 . Legal disputes about whether the state or his inheritors owned his papers led to a long delay in publication of his papers , but they eventually formed the starting point for further important work about the positions of the stars"
Thomas Hornsby,1763-1810,Corpus Christi College,Corpus Christi College,"Hornsby , who had an observatory at Corpus Christi , gained a high reputation for his lectures , and was the first Savilian astronomy professor required to provide courses each year . He presented papers about the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 and the solar eclipse of 1764 to the Royal Society , of which he was a Fellow . He proposed that an observatory should be built at Oxford for the professor , and construction of the Radcliffe Observatory ( and an adjoining house for him ) began in 1772 . The observatory began operation in 1774 and was completed in 1797 . He was called upon to prepare the papers of his predecessor , James Bradley , for publication , but ill-health and his other duties as astronomy professor , experimental philosophy professor ( from 1763 ) , Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy ( from 1782 ) and Radcliffe Librarian ( from 1783 ) caused delays . He has been described as a lucid lecturer and a remarkably accurate observer"
Abraham Robertson,1810-26,Christ Church,Christ Church,"Robertson started studying at Oxford aged 24 , having previously run ( unsuccessfully ) an evening school in Oxford for mechanics . He was supported by John Smith ( Savilian Professor of Geometry 1766-96 ) , for whom he deputised in 1784 before succeeding him in 1797 . He held the post of Radcliffe Observer in addition to the astronomy chair . Robertson was well-regarded as a lecturer , noted for his clarity and the assistance he gave in encouraging students . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1795 to mark his work on conic sections ( the subject of his main work , Sectionum conicarum libri septem , in 1792 ) and his literary attainments and diligence in the pursuit of science . He also oversaw publication of an edition of the works of Archimedes"
Stephen Rigaud,1827-39,Exeter College,-,"Rigaud , whose father was the observer at Kew Observatory , made his first recorded observations in astronomy when at Exeter College , and was elected to a fellowship of the college when still an undergraduate . From about 1805 , he substituted for Thomas Hornsby , astronomy professor and reader in experimental philosophy , because of Hornsby 's illness . When Abraham Robertson succeeded Hornsby in 1810 , Rigaud was appointed as Savilian Professor of Geometry ; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814 , becoming joint observer with his grandfather . He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827 . His wife died in the same year , and Rigaud devoted himself to his children and his work ; he has been described as the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation , and as renowned for his personal and scholarly integrity"
George Johnson,1839-42,The Queen 's College,The Queen 's College,"Johnson was a mathematician and priest with little practical knowledge of astronomy . His appointment led to the Radcliffe Trust , which oversaw the Radcliffe Observatory , appointing Manuel Johnson as the Radcliffe Observer instead . George Johnson became White 's Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1842 and then Dean of Wells in 1854 , where his time was marred by a dispute about his unpopular decision to hold a parish position in Wells in addition to the deanery to supplement his income"
William Donkin,1842-69,St Edmund Hall and University College,University College,"Donkin , a talented linguist , mathematician and musician , published papers on various astronomical and mathematical topics , including the movements of the Moon . He found new ways of solving Laplace 's equation and applied his mathematical knowledge to questions of acoustics , although he did not finish a proposed book on the topic before his death"
Charles Pritchard,1870-93,University of Cambridge ( St John 's College ),New College,"After leaving Cambridge , Pritchard was headmaster of a grammar school in Stockwell , south London , but left after a year because of disagreements with the school 's owners about his wish to teach science . His reforms were popular with some of the parents , however , and they established a school for him nearby in Clapham , where he was headmaster from 1834 to 1862 and installed an observatory and other scientific equipment . He was a member , and later president , of the Royal Astronomical Society , taking part in observations and the 1860 expedition to Spain to observe the solar eclipse . An ordained priest , he was appointed Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1867 , but never held a parish post . At the age of 62 , he was appointed to the Savilian chair and ( in the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ) entered upon his new duties with the ardour of youth . During his time in the position , an observatory was built in the University Parks , making Oxford one of the leading observatories in Europe . His use of photography to assist his observations and calculations of stellar parallax was rewarded with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society ( 1886 ) and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society ( 1892 )"
Herbert Turner,1893-1930,University of Cambridge ( Trinity College ),New College,"Turner was second wrangler ( achieved the second-highest marks in the Cambridge mathematics examinations ) in 1882 , and became chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1884 . He was involved with an international project to conduct a photographic survey and catalogue of stars , and devised a method of calculating a star 's true position , making the work much easier . This was recognised by the award of the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( 1927 ) . After his appointment to the Oxford professorship , his attempts to have a house built for him at the university 's observatory were unsuccessful , as the dispute between the university and the Radcliffe Observatory that had begun with George Johnson 's appointment in 1839 continued . He supported the decision of the Radcliffe trustees to move their observatory to a better site , in South Africa , in 1929 , but was attacked by fellow Oxford academics in the struggles for improving science facilities at the university thereafter . He was heavily involved in the work of the Royal Astronomical Society and international astronomical groups , and developed interests in geophysics and seismology , where he was one of the first to suggest that the earth 's core was liquid"
Harry Plaskett,1932-60,"University of Toronto and Imperial College , London",New College,"Plaskett , a solar physicist , was the son of the Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett . After serving in the Canadian Corps during the First World War , he studied spectroscopy with Alfred Fowler at Imperial College for a few months before taking up an appointment under his father at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory , British Columbia . He taught at Harvard College from 1928 , becoming professor of astrophysics in 1930 , and concentrated on solar research ( which he preferred to lecturing ) . During this time he met the Oxford mathematician and astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne , and they became close friends . On the death of Herbert Turner in 1930 , Milne warned Plaskett about the antiquated observatory at Oxford and the lack of university support and resources for the work of the Savilian professor , but Plaskett was undeterred and was appointed to the position . He constructed England 's first solar tower telescope to attract new researchers to Oxford , and reduced the work carried out at the observatory on seismology that Turner had begun , eliminating it in 1946 . He ended undergraduate tuition at the observatory and , with Milne , set up the first school of astrophysics in the country , based on the teaching of graduate students through research initiatives . He retired in 1960 , but continued his observations with his successor 's permission until he turned eighty in 1973 . Like his father , he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society"
Donald Blackwell,1960-88,University of Cambridge ( Sidney Sussex College ),New College,"Blackwell was assistant director of the Solar Physics Observatory at Cambridge from 1950 to 1960 , when he took up the Savilian professorship . He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1973 to 1975 , and visited various countries for his research"
George Efstathiou,1988-97,Keble College and the University of Durham,New College,"After completing his studies at Oxford and Durham , Efstathiou worked as an astronomy research assistant at the University of California Berkeley for one year , then became a Fellow of King 's College , Cambridge . Before his appointment as Savilian professor , he was Assistant Director of Research at the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge . After nine years in Oxford , he returned to Cambridge to take up a professorship , and became Director of the university 's Kavli Institute for Cosmology in 2008 . He has been awarded the Maxwell Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics ( 1990 ) and the Gruber Prize in Cosmology ( 2011 )"
Joseph Silk,1999-2012,University of Cambridge ( Clare College ) and Harvard University,New College,"After obtaining his doctorate from Harvard , Silk returned to England to carry out research at the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge . After a year at the Princeton University observatory , he moved to the University of California at Berkeley in 1970 , becoming Professor of Astronomy in 1978 . His astronomical interests include the formation of galaxies , dark matter detection , and temperature changes in space . His publications include The Big Bang ( 1980 ) and A Short History of the Universe ( 1994 )"
