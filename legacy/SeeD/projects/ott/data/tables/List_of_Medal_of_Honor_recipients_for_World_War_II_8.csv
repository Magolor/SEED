William J. Johnston,Army,Private First Class,"Anzio , Italy","February 17 , 1944 - February 19 , 1944","Johnston was a machine gunner attached to the Third Platoon of his company and that platoon was the furthest advanced element in the Company 's defenses . About eighty Germans advanced under the cover of an artillery barrage in the darkness and were within about 200 yards of the platoon 's positions when they were discovered by Johnston who was at his gun . He manned his machine gun and the attack was halted . All during the day , without relief , he remained with his weapon and fired at every target that presented itself . One German worked up the draw so close to the position that the machine gun could not be brought to bear upon him . Johnston drew his pistol and killed him . As the day wore on , it became evident that if the Company was to escape it would have to begin its movement . Not everyone could get out . Johnson volunteered to stay . Afterwards an artillery shell made what almost amounted to a direct hit on Johnston 's position and shell fragments penetrated into the left portion of his chest . An examination indicated that he was dying . The rapid advance of large numbers of the Germans prevented any evacuation . A few minutes later one of the last men to withdraw saw Johnston trying to crawl up to his machine gun . At Johnston 's request he was helped to his gun and left believing that he was dying . A few minutes later the Company heard the machine gun in action . It continued to fire for about 10 minutes . Afterwards the gun went silent . The Germans passed him as he lay in his position , and , believing him to be dead , stole his shoes . The next day , he painfully worked his way through the German lines to the 180th Regiment , after having been reported by the Company as killed in action . Despite his weakened condition , he gave accurate and vital information about the German positions on the base of which effective firing that was compiled"
