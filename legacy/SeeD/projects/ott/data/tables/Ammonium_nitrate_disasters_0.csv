United Kingdom,"Faversham , Kent","April 2 , 1916",115,"The Great Explosion : On April 2 , 1916 , a factory in Uplees , Faversham , exploded after a fire spread to a store of 25 tons of TNT and 700 tons of ammonium nitrate . The blast at the Explosives Loading Company killed 115 people and shattered windows in Southend-on-Sea across the Thames Estuary while the tremor was felt in Norwich"
United States,"Morgan , New Jersey ( now Sayreville )","October 4 , 1918",~100,"T. A. Gillespie Company Shell Loading Plant explosion : On October 4 , 1918 , an explosion at the Morgan Depot occurred leading to many artillery shells being launched into the air , some of which landed on a neighbouring warehouse where 4000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored in barrels . One of the shells caused a large explosion , but the majority of the ammonium nitrate did not detonate"
Germany,Kriewald,"July 26 , 1921",19,"On July 26 , 1921 , in this railway town ( now in Poland ) workers tried to dislodge 30 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had aggregated ( solidified into one mass ) in two wagons . When mining explosives were used on this solid mass the wagons exploded and killed nineteen people"
Germany,Oppau,"September 21 , 1921",561,"Explosion at BASF plant Oppau : Another attempt at disaggregation of a fertilizer mix with industrial explosives caused the death of 561 people and left more than 2000 injured . The fertilizer was a 50:50 mixture of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate and the factory had used this method of disaggregation over 20,000 times without incident . It is thought that , on this occasion , poor mixing had led to certain parts of the mass containing more ammonium nitrate than others . Only 450 tonnes exploded , out of 4500 tonnes of fertilizer stored in the warehouse"
United States,"Nixon , New Jersey ( now Edison Township )","March 1 , 1924",20,"1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster : On March 1 , 1924 , a fire and several large explosions destroyed a warehouse containing ammonium nitrate at the Nixon Nitration Works . The explosiveness of the product was perhaps enhanced , as it had been prepared using nitric acid that had previously been used for the production of TNT"
United States,"Muscle Shoals , Alabama",1925,0,"On April 4 , 1925 , and May 3 , 1925 , two carloads , each containing 220 barrels of ammonium nitrate , were dispatched from Muscle Shoals , Alabama , and caught fire in transportation . The barrels had been stored in a warehouse with varying humidity for 6 years , so it is believed that they were ignited by friction with their nitrate-impregnated manila paper lining . Other shipments were reportedly more successful"

Belgium,Tessenderlo,"April 29 , 1942",189,"Another attempt to disaggregate a pile of 150 tonnes of ammonium nitrate with industrial explosives ended tragically on April 29 , 1942 : 189 people were killed , 900 wounded"
United States,Texas City,"April 16 , 1947",581,"Texas City disaster : The cargo ship Grandcamp was being loaded on April 16 , 1947 , when a fire was detected in the hold : at this point , 2300 tons of ammonium nitrate in sacks were already aboard . The captain responded by closing the hold and pumping in pressurised steam . One hour later , the ship exploded , killing several hundred people and setting fire to another vessel , the High Flyer , which was moored 250 metres away and which contained 1050 tonnes of sulfur and 960 tons of ammonium nitrate . The Grandcamp explosion also created a powerful earthshock that broke windows as far as 40 miles away and knocked two small planes flying at 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) out of the sky . The High Flyer exploded the next day , after having burned for sixteen hours . 500 tonnes of ammonium nitrate on the quayside also burned , but without exploding , probably because it was less tightly packed . All but one member of the Texas City fire department died"
France,Brest,"July 28 , 1947",29,"The Norwegian cargo ship Ocean Liberty was loaded with 3300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and various flammable products when it caught fire at 12:30 July 28 , 1947 . The captain ordered the hold to be sealed and pressurised steam was pumped in . As this did not stop the fire , the vessel was towed out of the harbour at 14:00 , and exploded at 17:00 . The explosion caused 29 deaths and serious damage to the port of Brest"
-,Red Sea,1953,0,"A fire was detected on the cargo ship Tirrenia on January 23 , 1953 , while it was carrying 4000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate . Attempts to extinguish the fire with steam were unsuccessful , and the ship was abandoned before it exploded later in the night"
United States,"Roseburg , Oregon","August 7 , 1959",14,"The Roseburg Blast : A truck carrying dynamite and ammonium nitrate caught fire early in the morning of August 7 , 1959 .

United States,"Traskwood , Arkansas","December 17 , 1960",0,"On December 17 , 1960 , a 96 freight car train suffered partial derailment , in which the last 23 cars were derailed . The derailed cars included : four fuel oil tank cars , two tank cars of gasoline , three tank cars of petroleum oil , four cars of lube oil drums , three cars of liquid fertilizer , one car of fuming nitric acid and two cars of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate . In this particular accident , neither car of ammonium nitrate exploded . However , the nitric acid reacted with the fuel oil , essentially creating ANFO to feed the conflagration , resulting in the spread of the ammonium nitrate material around the incident site"
Australia,"Taroom , Queensland","August 30 , 1972",3,"A truck carrying ammonium nitrate experienced an electrical fault and caught fire north of Taroom . After the driver stopped and parked the burning truck , two brothers from a nearby cattle property who saw the fire rode up on motorbikes to assist . The three men were killed when the truck exploded . The explosion burnt out more than 2000 acres of surrounding bushland , and left a deep crater where the truck had been parked . A memorial to the three men was unveiled at the accident site in 2013"
United States,"Kansas City , Missouri","November 29 , 1988",6,"On November 29 , 1988 , at 4:07 AM two trailers containing approximately 50,000 lb ( 23,000 kg ) of the explosive ANFO ( ammonium nitrate with fuel oil ) exploded at a construction site located near the 87th street exit of Highway 71 in Kansas City , Missouri . The explosives were to be used in the blasting of rock while constructing Highway 71 . The result of the explosions were the deaths of six firemen from the Kansas City Fire Department 's Pumper Companies 30 and 41 . Both companies were dispatched after 911 calls indicated that a pickup truck located near the trailers had been set on fire . The responding companies were warned that there were explosives on-site ; however , they were unaware that the trailers were essentially magazines filled with explosives . At 4:07 AM one of the magazines caught fire and a catastrophic explosion occurred , killing all six firemen instantly - only sparing remains were found . A second blast occurred 40 minutes later , although all fire crews had been pulled back at this time . The blasts created two craters , each approximately 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide and 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) deep . The explosions also shattered windows within a 10-mile ( 16 km ) area and could be heard 40 miles ( 64 km ) away . It was later determined that the explosions were acts of arson , set by individuals embroiled in a labor dispute with the construction company contracted to build the highway"

The fatal explosion involved at most a few tonnes of explosive . A larger explosion of about 80 tonnes of emulsion ( Ammonium Nitrate Emulsion , ANE , UN 3375 ) was caused by fires under storage facilities at the site at 11:02 AM . There were no fatalities in the second explosion because the site had been evacuated . A mushroom cloud was seen to rise . ANE is an emulsion of ammonium nitrate , fuel and water"

Four people were killed and 18 injured . Approximately 5,700 tons of anhydrous ammonia were released and releases of ammonia continued for six days after the explosions . Groundwater under the processing plant was contaminated by chemicals released as a result of the blast . The timing of the explosion occurred prior to the start of the arrival of the 8:00 AM shift personnel , or the death toll might have been larger"
China,"Xingping , Shaanxi","January 6 , 1998",22,"At midnight on January 6 , 1998 , the Xinghua Fertilizer company had a series of explosions in the plant . About 27.6 tons of ammonium nitrate liquor was in a container there . The explosion claimed 22 lives , with a further 56 wounded . The explosion was officially announced as an accident"
