Name,Years,Education,College as Professor,Notes
Henry Briggs,1619-1631,University of Cambridge ( St John 's College ),Merton College,"Briggs was a lecturer in mathematics and in physic ( medicine ) at Cambridge , also becoming the first professor of geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1597 . He had become acquainted with the principles of Napier 's logarithm by 1615 : logarithms aided the calculations of astronomy and navigation that were carried out at Gresham since they allowed multiplication of multi-digit numbers to be carried out through the addition of their logarithms . The innovation that Briggs suggested to Napier was to use steps of 10 ( the common logarithm ) . After two visits by Briggs to John Napier in Edinburgh , they agreed a redefinition of the logarithm process , but Napier wrote in 1617 that the calculations would have to be carried out by others , including Briggs , because of his own ill health . Briggs is regarded as having created one of the most useful systems for mathematics . In 1624 , his main work , Arithmetica logarithmica , was published with calculations of the logarithms of 1 to 20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000 to fourteen decimal places . He died in Merton in 1631 and was buried in the choir of Merton College chapel"
Peter Turner,1631-1648,St Mary Hall and Christ Church,Merton College,"Turner succeeded Briggs as professor of geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1620 ; he succeeded him in the Savilian professorship and resigned as Gresham professor in 1631 . Before this , he had been asked by William Laud ( Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University of Oxford ) to help draft new statutes to govern the university ; the final draft was his work , and was published in 1634 . During the English Civil War , he fought on the side of the Royalists and was captured near Stow-on-the-Wold in 1641 ; he was imprisoned in Southwark until an exchange of prisoners in 1643 . He was evicted from his fellowship at Merton and from the professorship by the Parliamentary visitors in charge of the university in 1648 , and died in poverty in 1652 . He appears to have published little of substance , despite a good contemporary reputation as a mathematician and classical scholar"
John Wallis,1649-1703,University of Cambridge ( Emmanuel College ),Exeter College,"Before he entered Cambridge , Wallis was taught some mathematics at the age of 15 by his elder brother . He later claimed to have been self-taught in mathematics thereafter , saying in his autobiography that he had studied it as a pleasing Diversion , at spare hours , adding that it then was regarded as more for Traders , Merchants , Seamen , Carpenters , Surveyors of Lands , or the like than as a subject for academical study at university level . He developed an interest in cryptography , working on behalf of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War . He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society , writing over sixty papers and book reviews for it . After his appointment to the chair , he developed his mathematical skills such that he became one of the leading mathematicians of his time : he introduced ∞ { \displaystyle \infty } as the sign for infinity , influenced Isaac Newton with his writings , and took part in various mathematical debates with scholars such as Blaise Pascal and Thomas Hobbes . He was appointed Keeper of the Archives for the university in 1658 , and continued in his posts after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 until his death at the age of 86"
Edmond Halley,1704-1742,The Queen 's College,The Queen 's College,"Halley , who later calculated the orbit of what became known as Halley 's comet , was already in correspondence with European astronomers as an undergraduate , writing three scientific papers in this time . He left Oxford to travel to St Helena for the 1677 transit of Mercury , so that he could calculate the distance of the sun ; his work brought him a leading reputation in Europe and election to the Royal Society aged 22 . He questioned Isaac Newton on the orbits of the planets , leading Newton to renew his study of the topic and write his Principia Mathematica in 1687 ; Halley supervised and paid for its publication . He failed to be appointed as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in 1691 , but was appointed by Newton to a position in the Royal Mint instead . His own works included discussion of rainbows , optics and barometers , and he calculated the site of Julius Caesar 's invasion of Britain by reference to the tides . He also carried out navigational surveys on behalf of the Royal Navy and drew up tables calculating the positions of the sun , moon and planets for many centuries . He was appointed Astronomer Royal in 1721"
Nathaniel Bliss,1742-1764,Pembroke College,Pembroke College,"Bliss was appointed rector of St Ebbe 's Church , Oxford , in 1736 . When he applied to succeed Halley , his supporters included James Bradley ( the Astronomer Royal ) and Robert Smith ( professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge ) . As professor , he established an observatory ( the fourth in the city ) by attaching his instruments to a part of Oxford city wall near his official house . He provided astronomical measurements to Bradley and George Parker , 2nd Earl of Macclesfield , who had an observatory at Shirburn Castle . Bliss succeeded Bradley as Astronomer Royal in 1762 , but died suddenly in 1764"
Joseph Betts,1765-1766,University College,University College,"Betts tried and failed to be elected as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in 1763 , the post going to Thomas Hornsby instead . His supporters at that election included George Lee , 3rd Earl of Lichfield ( the university 's Chancellor ) , John Stuart , 3rd Earl of Bute ( Prime Minister 1762-1763 ) , and George Montagu-Dunk , 2nd Earl of Halifax ( Secretary of State ) . He expressed his thanks to them in the dedication of a print of the annular solar eclipse of 1 April 1764"
John Smith,1766-1796,Balliol College and St Mary Hall,St Mary Hall,"Smith studied at Balliol from 1744 onwards , receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1748 , his Master of Arts degree in 1751 and his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1753 . He obtained his Doctor of Medicine degree as a member of St Mary Hall , and was working as a doctor in Cheltenham in 1784 , when Abraham Robertson deputised for him . Smith built a stable and a small tenement behind his official house , destroying part of the medieval city wall as he did so , and bequeathed both additions to his successors in the chair in a rather pompous clause in his will"
Abraham Robertson,1797-1810,Christ Church,Christ Church,"Robertson started studying at Oxford aged 24 , having previously unsuccessfully run an evening school in Oxford for mechanics . He was supported by John Smith , and deputised for him in 1784 as Smith was working as a doctor in Cheltenham . He was well-regarded as a lecturer , noted for his clarity and the assistance he gave in encouraging students . He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1795 to mark his work on conic sections ( the subject of his main work , Sectionum conicarum libri septem , in 1792 ) and his literary attainments and diligence in the pursuit of science . He also oversaw publication of an edition of the works of Archimedes . He succeeded Smith in 1797 , and became Savilian professor of astronomy in 1810"
Stephen Rigaud,1810-1827,Exeter College,-,"Rigaud , whose father was the observer at Kew Observatory , made his first recorded observations in astronomy when at Exeter College , and was elected to a fellowship of the college when still an undergraduate . From about 1805 , he substituted for Thomas Hornsby , Savilian Professor of Astronomy and reader in experimental philosophy , because of Hornsby 's illness . When Robertson succeeded Hornsby in 1810 , Rigaud was appointed to the geometry chair ; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814 , becoming joint observer with his grandfather . He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827 . His wife died in the same year , and Rigaud devoted himself to his children and his work ; he has been described as the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation , and as renowned for his personal and scholarly integrity"
Baden Powell,1827-1860,Oriel College,-,"Powell carried out experiments in the areas of heat and light when he was a parish priest in Kent and London , although he found it difficult to keep abreast with mathematical advances in physics and some of the papers he offered to the Royal Society in the 1830s had considerable mistakes . He resigned his parish position when appointed to the chair , and was an active member of scientific organisations and commissions , with many publications to his credit . He was also noted for his stance on theological issues , opposing the work of the Oxford movement ( a group within the Church of England , sometimes referred to as Tractarians , who aimed to reform the church by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church ) , denying miracles and defending the theories of Charles Darwin . He advocated reform within the university , including improving the position of scientific studies , but opposition to his stance left him isolated at Oxford . He moved to London in 1854 , and mixed with leading individuals from science and literature . One of his sons was Robert Baden-Powell , the founder of the Scout Movement"
Henry Smith,1861-1883,Balliol College,Balliol College and Corpus Christi College,"Smith 's undergraduate studies at Oxford were interrupted by smallpox and malaria , but he studied in Paris during his convalescence and obtained first-class degrees in classics and also in mathematics in the same year . A fellow and lecturer in mathematics at Balliol , Smith also oversaw the college 's laboratory and taught chemistry ; he also arranged for lectures in mathematics to be given jointly with other colleges , a system that was adopted by other colleges and subjects and later grew into a university-based lecture system . From 1874 , he was also Keeper of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History . He was heavily involved with university committees , advocating the place of science and mathematics at Oxford , and with royal commissions on scientific instruction and on universities . His mathematical research in geometry , elliptic function theory and ( in particular ) number theory was highly regarded"
James Sylvester,1883-1894,University of London and University of Cambridge ( St John 's College ),New College,"Sylvester started at the University of London aged 14 but left after allegedly assaulting another student ; he later studied at Cambridge and was Second Wrangler ( second in the university mathematics examinations ) but could not be awarded a degree or prizes , or be made a college fellow , because he was Jewish . He then became professor of natural philosophy at University College , London for three years before moving to the University of Virginia in 1841 , resigning after a dispute with university authorities in 1842 . Back in England , he worked as an actuary , carrying out mathematical research in elimination theory in his spare time , before appointment as professor of mathematics at Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , in 1855 . After compulsory retirement aged 55 , he spent a few years writing poetry and enjoying his club before returning to the United States in 1876 as professor of mathematics at the newly opened Johns Hopkins University , in Baltimore , Maryland . The move reinvigorated his research on invariant theory and matrix theory ; he published the results in the American Journal of Mathematics , which he founded . During this time , he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society . Homesick , he applied for the Savilian professorship ( Oxford having lifted the bar on Jewish academics ) and resigned from Johns Hopkins before receiving news of his appointment . He delayed his inaugural lecture until 1885 because he had difficulty finding a suitable topic . With his health failing , a deputy was appointed for him in 1892 ; he resigned in 1894 . The Royal Society inaugurated the Sylvester Medal in his honour in 1901"
William Esson,1897-1916,St John 's College,New College,"Esson , a fellow of Merton College from 1860 , acted as deputy professor from 1894 until his appointment in 1897 , when he became a fellow of New College . His work with Augustus Harcourt on the rate of chemical change ( published in three papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , spread over 30 years ) led to the award of fellowship of the Royal Society in 1869 ; one obituary notice said that the remainder of his publications were neither numerous nor of great importance . In his obituary , The Times called him a distinguished veteran in mathematical science , who had devoted himself to higher mathematics and its connexions with natural science with eminent success"
G. H. Hardy,1919-1931,University of Cambridge ( Trinity College ),New College,"Hardy was awarded a prize fellowship at Trinity College in 1900 , and published the first of his research papers ( which eventually totalled over 350 ) in the same year . His collaboration with J. E. Littlewood began in 1911 , a partnership described as the most famous in the history of mathematics , with more than 100 joint papers on topics such as distribution of prime numbers , mathematical analysis , analytic number theory , and solving the Waring problem . He also worked with the Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan . He was a friend and colleague of the philosopher Bertrand Russell and was upset by Russell 's treatment by Cambridge for his pacifist views during the First World War . He was happier in Oxford , but returned to Cambridge in 1931 to take up the position of Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics . His contribution to population genetics is known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle , described by a biographer of Hardy ( the Cambridge mathematician Béla Bollobás ) as one of the few exceptions to Hardy 's claim that nothing he had done , for good or ill , had made or was likely to make the least difference to the amenity of the world"
Edward Titchmarsh,1931-1963,Balliol College,New College,"Titchmarsh studied with Hardy and acted as his secretary before obtaining a lectureship at University College , London in 1923 ; he was also a non-resident fellow of Magdalen College , Oxford between 1924 and 1930 . He was professor of pure mathematics at the University of Liverpool from 1929 until succeeding Hardy at Oxford in 1931 . As Titchmarsh ( unlike Hardy ) had said when applying that he was unwilling to lecture on geometry , one of the requirements of the Oxford chair , the stipulation was removed for him . He was a leading figure in Oxford mathematics thereafter , publishing extensively and winning the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society in 1955 , but had little enthusiasm for lecturing"
Michael Atiyah,1963-1969,University of Cambridge ( Trinity College ),New College,"Atiyah taught and carried out research in Cambridge and in the United States ( at Princeton University , New Jersey ) . He then moved to Oxford in 1961 , initially as a Fellow of St Catherine 's College and Reader in Mathematics , before he succeeded Titchmarsh . He moved back to Princeton to take up a chair in 1969 , although returned to Oxford in 1973 as Royal Society Research Professor . In 1990 , he became Master of Trinity College , Cambridge ( a post he held until 1997 ) , and was later President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( 2005-2008 ) . He was knighted in 1983 and made a member of the Order of Merit in 1992 . Mathematical awards include the Fields Medal ( 1966 ) for his work on K-theory and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem ( work which has been used by theoretical physicists ) and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society ( 1988 )"
Ioan James,1970-1995,The Queen 's College,New College,"After studying at Oxford , James moved to the United States to carry out research at Princeton University in New Jersey and at University of California , Berkeley , returning to a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . In 1957 , James became Reader in Pure Mathematics at Oxford , and also was a senior research fellow at St John 's College from 1959 until his appointment to the Savilian professorship in 1970 . He retired in 1995 , becoming professor emeritus . His research topics were in the field of topology , especially homotopy , and he has also written on the history of topology and edited a journal on the subject"
Richard Taylor,1995-1996,University of Cambridge ( Clare College ),New College,"Taylor studied at Cambridge and in the United States at Princeton University , New Jersey , before becoming a fellow of Clare College in 1988 . He moved to Oxford in 1995 , but resigned after one year to take up a chair at Harvard University . He has worked on Langlands program and , with others , proved the Sato-Tate conjecture , and collaborated with Andrew Wiles on the solution to Fermat 's last theorem . He was awarded the Shaw Prize in 2007 ( along with Robert Langlands ) for initiating and developing a grand unifying vision of mathematics that connects prime numbers with symmetry"
Nigel Hitchin,1997-2016,Jesus College and Wolfson College,New College,"Hitchin taught in the United States at Princeton University in New Jersey and at New York University , then returned to Wolfson College for further research before becoming a fellow and tutor at St Catherine 's College . He was a professor of mathematics at Warwick University before becoming Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 1994 . His research areas include differential geometry , algebraic geometry , Hyperkähler geometry and special Lagrangian geometry"
Frances Kirwan,2017 onwards,University of Cambridge ( Clare College ) and Balliol College,New College,"Kirwan held a Junior Fellowship at Harvard from 1983 to 1985 , and held a Fellowship at Magdalen College , Oxford from 1983 to 1986 , before becoming a fellow at Balliol College , Oxford . Her research interests include moduli spaces in algebraic geometry , geometric invariant theory ( GIT ) , and in the link between GIT and moment maps in symplectic geometry . Her work endeavours to understand the structure of geometric objects by investigation of their algebraic and topological properties"
