Name,Game,Notes

Andrew Ryan,BioShock,"Half Antagonist in BioShock , created the underwater city of Rapture as a refuge from a world consumed by government , altruism and religion . I believe in no God , no invisible man in the sky"
Sibrand,Assassin 's Creed,"In his last words to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad after the latter dealt with the Teutonic knight with his Hidden Blade and said that he would be safe in the arms of God soon enough , Sibrand replied that there was nothing waiting for him in the end , not even God or the afterlife , that they did not even exist and that it was the one thing what he feared most"
Rodrigo Borgia,Assassin 's Creed II,"During his duel with Ezio Auditore da Firenze at the Vatican Vault , after failing to activate the Vault door because he did not have any First Civilization DNA in him , Rodrigo told to Ezio in the middle of the duel that he looked for God in the vault , shocking Ezio , which led to the latter to ask whether God was really in the Vault . Rodrigo replied that God being in the Vatican vault was a more logical answer and far more interesting than God being in the sky with angels singing cherubim all around . Ezio then asked what God would do once Rodrigo entered the vault . Rodrigo replied he was only after power , which Ezio asked whether God would give it up easily . Rodrigo then told that whatever lay beyond the Vault wall would not be able to resist the Staff and Apple and that they were made for felling gods . Ezio , being already a believer , replied that God was omniscient and omnipotent , and that mere artifacts could not harm Him , to which Rodrigo falsely accused Ezio that he took up the image of God from other men . Ezio was shocked to learn of Rodrigo 's atheism and rejection of the Bible , despite his papacy . Rodrigo then scoffed that Ezio was still too naive . Rodrigo then replied : I became Pope because it gave me ACCESS . It gave me POWER . Do you think I believe a single god-damned word of that ridiculous book ? It 's all lies and superstition . Just like every OTHER religious tract written over the past ten thousand years"
Al Mualim,Assassin 's Creed ( 2007 video game ),"During his final fight with Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad in Masyaf and brief talks about the Apple of Eden while the latter was bound by the Apple 's powers , Al Mualim confirmed that Altaïr was immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden , to which Altaïr asked what illusion it was . Al Mualim said : That 's all it 's ever done , this Templar treasure , this Piece of Eden , this word of God . Do you understand now ? The Red Sea was never parted , water never turned to wine . It was not the machinations of Eris that spawned the Trojan War , but this ! Illusions , all of them ! Altaïr argued that what Al Mualim had planned was no less than an illusion , to force men to work for him against their will . Al Mualim then denies the existence of any God whatsoever , by saying : Is it any less real than the phantoms the Saracens and Crusaders follow now ? Those craven Gods , who retreat from this world that men might slaughter one another in their names ? They live amongst an illusion already . I 'm simply giving them another , one that demands less blood . Altaïr then said that they were safer choosing these phantoms , confirming that it was better to believe in some higher entity than believing in nothing at all . Al Mualim was disappointed , claiming that logic had left Altaïr 's mind and was replaced with emotion . Still unconvinced , Altaïr was released from being bound to the Apple 's power , after which he swiftly defeated Al Mualim in combat with some difficulty , finally ending his Mentor 's life by plunging his Hidden Blade into his throat . During Al Mualim 's final moments , he tells Altaïr to take the Apple , to which Altaïr replied to his Mentor that he held fire in his hand , which should have been destroyed . Al Mualim was not convinced even then , believing that the Apple could end the Crusades and create true peace and that he would never destroy it . Altaïr then promised him that he would destroy it , with the latter dying after challenging his student to truly destroy it"
Mario Auditore,Assassin 's Creed II,"When speaking of the Auditore Villa Pastor to Ezio , Mario says The prete ( priest ) seems a nice enough fellow , but I 've never been much of a believer"
Arno Dorian,Assassin 's Creed Unity,"By the end of the game , Arno described the Creed in strongly atheistic terms and claims that there exists no higher power to judge humanity nor does a supreme being watch over humanity or punishes them for their sins , and that only humanity itself can guard itself against its own obsessions"
Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad,Assassin 's Creed ( 2007 video game ),"After starting to research on the Apple of Eden , Altaïr began to have doubts about the existence of a God , citing various conflicts and contradictions in the religious books available in the Holy Land during his time , noting how cruel they were in their punishments of those who rejected the books , and thus began noting them down in his Codex . Altaïr , much like Arno Dorian , professed the Assassin 's creed in strongly atheistic terms and called the light of God as a light that blinds society and forces it to stumble about in ignorance"
Niko Bellic,GTA IV,"This main character often muses that he does not care whether or not God exists , saying that any faith he had died after the numerous atrocities that he witnessed and took part in during the war , however , in reality , he does not agree to this point and constantly shouts out to God to bless Liberty City . He states that because of his firsthand experience of seeing what human beings are capable of , he does not believe humans have souls . However , he did say that only barbaric creatures did not have any souls and that he did not know whether God is complicated or not"
