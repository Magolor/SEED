"Benfield Barn , Hangleton",1.43 acres ( 0.58 ha ),1989,"The city 's smallest conservation area includes a Grade II-listed barn - part of an ancient farm next to the former Benfield Manor house - and the four terraced cottages which replaced it . The red-brick and flint barn may be late-18th-century , and the houses were built in 1871 for farm workers . They are of yellow stock brick with slate-tiled roofs"
"Brunswick Town , Hove",95.92 acres ( 38.82 ha ),1969,"Local architecture evolved into serious Neoclassical at this carefully planned and landscaped set-piece in the mid-1820s . Columns of various orders , pilasters and bow fronts characterise the square and its flanking terraces , all of which enjoy sea views and access to extensive lawns . Smaller squares and streets , such as Adelaide Crescent , Lansdowne Place and Palmeira Square , surround the centrepiece , and are slightly more modest in scope . Stuccoed façades , slate roofs , consistent building heights and long parapets contribute to the impression of regularity and formality"
Carlton Hill,4.05 acres ( 1.64 ha ),2008,"This early-19th-century working-class area was comprehensively redeveloped in the mid-20th century after degenerating into a slum , but a few old buildings remain : Tilbury Place is a good example of Georgian architecture , George Cheesman junior 's severely Classical church dates from 1839 , and the cobble-fronted Mighell Farmhouse survived when adjacent buildings were demolished for Amex House , a large office block . The area 's character derives from these buildings , its site on a steep hill with long views , and the survival of fragments of old street layouts and boundary walls in places"
"Cliftonville , Hove",40.05 acres ( 16.21 ha ),1969,"A small area of delightful mid- Victorian houses , in a villa style with angled bay windows and exterior ironwork , this 1850s suburb is an example of the long-lasting influence of the Regency style on Victorian domestic architecture . The increasingly fashionable Italianate style is also evident . Slight differences can be seen between individual houses : plots were sold speculatively , so most houses were built to individuals ' requirements . Sash windows with valances are characteristic features"
College,18.60 acres ( 7.53 ha ),1988,"Many architects associated with Brighton have made complementary additions to George Gilbert Scott 's original buildings for Brighton College , founded in 1848 : T.G . Jackson , F.T . Cawthorn and Clayton & Black , amongst others . Pevsner found the ensemble joyless , but they are important as Brighton 's largest set of Gothic Revival buildings ( a style rarely found among secular buildings in the city ) . Flint and brick predominate , and there is much use of terracotta"
"Denmark Villas , Hove",7.42 acres ( 3.00 ha ),1984,"This road was a northern extension of Cliftonville , built on the way to Hove railway station ( opened in 1865 ) . The area has well-spaced Italianate houses in a more modestly detailed style than the rest of Cliftonville , with prominent architraves , quoins and eaves , yellow brickwork and mosaic tiled paths . The road is lined with mature trees , contributing to its character"
East Cliff,153.99 acres ( 62.32 ha ),1973,"Hundreds of listed buildings , a strong and little changed street pattern and the prevalence of Regency architecture characterise the East Cliff , which developed from the late 18th century because of its proximity to the fashionable Old Steine . Many landowners held small plots , so cohesive large-scale developments were not possible ; instead , streets tended to follow a north-south alignment defined by old field boundaries . The houses and hotels of Marine Parade , the east-west clifftop road ( built from 1827 on the site of a trackway ) , present a long stuccoed façade which has been described as unsurpassed anywhere in Britain"
"Engineerium , West Blatchington",8.89 acres ( 3.60 ha ),1982,"Built in 1866 as the Goldstone Pumping Station to provide more piped water for Brighton and Hove 's rapidly growing population , this became a museum in 1976 . Considered to be excellent examples of 19th-century industrial design , the brick buildings are intricately detailed with Classical motifs and multicoloured brickwork . The tall chimney is a significant landmark"
Hangleton,15.54 acres ( 6.29 ha ),1984,"Hangleton became a postwar overspill estate , with what Pevsner called a grisly set of parodies of the English cottage , but at the centre a set of ancient buildings remain around a park . St Helen 's Church has changed little since the 11th century , and Hangleton Manor is Hove 's oldest secular building . Now used as a restaurant , it retains its old dovecote and associated cottages"
Hove Station,14.56 acres ( 5.89 ha ),1996,"Built as Cliftonville in 1865 , Hove railway station soon stimulated middle-class residential development . Goldstone Villas , a wide tree-lined avenue with terraced houses in various styles , was developed in the 1880s and 1890s . Brick in pale colours such as yellow , buff and brown predominates ; slate roofs are also common , and many windows are canted bays . Some large-scale late-20th-century developments have affected the area . The Ralli Memorial Hall , a red brick and stone Renaissance-style building of 1913 , and a Neoclassical former chapel of 1878 ( now an office ) provide variety"
Kemp Town,47.94 acres ( 19.40 ha ),1970,"The estate has two sea-facing terraces ( Arundel and Chichester Terrace ) linked to a three-sided square ( Sussex Square ) by Lewes Crescent , an 840-foot ( 260 m ) double curve of 28 stuccoed houses with large Corinthian pilasters at regular intervals . Charles Busby 's original designs were followed most closely in the crescent ; the 300-by-550-foot ( 91 m × 168 m ) square took longer to complete and diverges from his plan . Chichester Terrace was finished only in 1855 . Thomas Cubitt built 37 of the estate 's 106 houses . Surrounding mews and backstreets , the private gardens at the centre , original street furniture and the seafront esplanade ( by Henry Kendall ) are included in the conservation area"
Montpelier & Clifton Hill,75.40 acres ( 30.51 ha ),1973,"Clifton Hill rises gently to a summit between the old town centre and West Hill . Built up from the 1820s to the 1860s , the southwest-facing slopes became Brighton 's most desirable suburb . Regency and Italianate architecture dominate the area , and many buildings are stuccoed . St Nicholas ' Church , Brighton 's ancient parish church , is in the area , and is one of hundreds of listed buildings . Other listed churches include St Michael and All Angels , whose interior is considered the best in England , and St Mary Magdalen , but the Gothic Christ Church burnt down in the 1970s and was replaced by International/Modern-style flats"
North Laine,41.37 acres ( 16.74 ha ),1977,"Based around the east end of Church Street , the oldest road , this tightly packed residential and commercial area was developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , helped by Brighton railway station 's proximity . A laine was an open field which was divided into strips ( furlongs and paul-pieces ) separated by pathways ; pre-modern Brighton was surrounded by five , including North Laine . The boundaries defined the pattern of development : main roads ( such as Church Street ) follow the old paths , while side streets run at right-angles along the furlongs and paul-pieces . Total redevelopment was proposed in the 1960s , but the area survived ; its attractive townscape has a distinctive ambience which makes it the heart and soul of Brighton"
Old Hove,34.44 acres ( 13.94 ha ),1997,"Hove Street - the ancient village street , whose manor house was demolished in the 1930s - and its surroundings make up this conservation area . Most housing is of the late 19th century : large , mostly semi-detached or terraced and built of red brick . St Andrew 's , the former parish church ( rebuilt in a Neo-Norman / Romanesque style by George Basevi in 1834 ) and Hove Public Library are both listed buildings . The former Connaught Road School , of brown and red brick with Dutch gables and terracotta dressings , adds further interest"
Old Town,46.77 acres ( 18.93 ha ),1973,"The narrow , winding twittens known as The Lanes were built up in the 16th and 17th centuries as Brighton 's fishing industry thrived . Most surviving buildings come from a second period of growth in the 18th and 19th centuries , as small houses were built for newly arrived workers . Many have been converted into small independent shops . Several old pubs , Thomas Lainson 's Byzantine Revival Middle Street Synagogue ( 1875 ) and the Quaker meeting house ( 1805 ) are also in the area"
Ovingdean,48.58 acres ( 19.66 ha ),1970,"Events in Harrison Ainsworth 's novel Ovingdean Grange are fictional , but the building ( formerly the manor house ) exists in the centre of this downland village , inland from Rottingdean and 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) east of Brighton . St Wulfran 's Church , whose churchyard contains a memorial to the family of William Willett , is 12th-century . The adjacent rectory , Ovingdean Hall ( a school until 2010 ) and many flint cottages , mostly of the 18th century , surround the village green and main street"
Patcham,20.78 acres ( 8.41 ha ),1970,"This ancient downland village was extensively suburbanised in the interwar period , but the core of the village - around All Saints Church - remains intact . One of Sussex 's largest villages ( and parishes ) in the 11th century , the population declined by the 19th century ; the conservation area 's boundary match those of the village as it was from the 1870s until expansion began ( as a result of its inclusion within the Borough of Brighton in 1928 ) . Well-wooded parkland , especially around the Grade II*-listed Patcham Place , and access to the South Downs ( affected by construction of the Brighton Bypass in the 1990s ) contribute to the area 's character . Many buildings are of flint or cobblestone ; some have glazed black mathematical tiles"
"Pembroke & Princes , Hove",54.74 acres ( 22.15 ha ),1989,"Most of this area consists of large late Victorian and early Edwardian houses built during Hove 's westward expansion . There is also some later housing , mainly of the 1920s and 1930s . Large front gardens , wide curved tree-lined streets , tile-hung façades , painted exterior timbers and hipped roofs with gable ends characterise the area . Non-residential buildings of interest include the Italianate Brooker Hall , now a museum , and Barford Court - an unusual Neo-Georgian/ Art Deco nursing home built of handmade purple bricks"
Portslade Old Village,34.21 acres ( 13.84 ha ),1974,"Portslade sits in a valley west of Hove and has pre-medieval origins ; the old village clusters around St Nicolas ' Church and the ruined manor house . Pevsner thought that the combination of small flint-walled cottages and a huge Classical / Italianate brewery building of 1881 made it a bizarre landscape . Extensive parkland , nearby woodland , extensive flint walling and some large 19th-century detached houses contribute to the area 's character . Many buildings are listed"
Preston Park,214.47 acres ( 86.79 ha ),1970,"This area consists of the extensive late-19th-century residential areas north and east of Preston Park : the park itself is part of the neighbouring Preston Village conservation area . Developed in a controlled , architecturally harmonious manner between 1865 and 1885 , the long , straight streets of brick villas have features such as timbered gables , decorated bargeboards , canted bay windows and walls combining red brickwork and stucco . Two churches , including the Grade II-listed St Augustine 's , contribute to the character of the area"
