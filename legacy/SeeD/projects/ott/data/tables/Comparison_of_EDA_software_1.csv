Electric,"*BSD , Java",GPL,Yes,VLSI circuit design tool with connectivity at all levels . Can also be used for schematic entry and PCB design
FreePCB,w32,GPL,Yes,"A printed circuit board design program for Microsoft Windows . FreePCB allows for up to 16 copper layers , both metric and US customary units , and export of designs in Gerber format . Boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the FreeRouting autorouter by using the FpcROUTE Specctra DSN design file translator"
Fritzing,"Windows , Mac , Linux",GPL,Yes,"Protoboard view , schematic view , PCB view , Code ( firmware ) view . Includes customizable design rule checker . Includes common shaped boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi shields . Allows spline curve traces . Only two layers ( top and bottom ) . Outputs gerbers"

Verilator,Posix,GPL,No,"Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator . It compiles synthesizable Verilog into cycle accurate C++ or SystemC code following 2-state synthesis ( zero delay ) semantics . Benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as ModelSim , NC-Verilog and VCS , while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as Carbon ModelStudio and ARC VTOC"
XCircuit,Unix,GPL,No,Used to produce netlists and publish high-quality drawings
