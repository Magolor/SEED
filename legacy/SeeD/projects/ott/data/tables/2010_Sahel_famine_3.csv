Chad,"Chad is divided into three distinct zones , from the Sudanese savanna in the south , the Sahel in the central belt and the Sahara Desert in the north . The most fertile land is around the steadily shrinking Lake Chad",20.8,Sahel and CILLS
Central African Republic,"The climate of the C.A.R . is generally tropical . The northern areas are subject to harmattan winds , which are hot , dry , and carry dust . The northern regions have been subject to desertification , and the northeast is a desert . The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers as much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River , with the Mbomou River in the east merging with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River . In the west , the Sangha River flows through part of the country . The eastern border lies along the edge of the Nile river watershed . The estimated amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8% , with the densest parts in the south . It is highly diverse , and includes commercially important species of Ayous , Sapelli and Sipo . The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum , and lumber poaching is commonplace",18.4,No
Cameroon,"The climate varies with the terrain . The climate is exceedingly hot and humid , the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth . For example , Debundscha , at the base of Mt . Cameroon , has an average annual rainfall of 405 inches ( 10,287 mm ) . The coastal plain extends 15 to 150 kilometres ( 9 to 93 mi ) inland from the Gulf of Guinea and has an average elevation of 90 metres ( 295 ft ) . Exceedingly hot and humid with a short dry season , this belt is densely forested and includes some of the wettest places on earth , part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests . The South Cameroon Plateau rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of 650 metres ( 2,133 ft ) . Equatorial rainforest dominates this region , although its alternation between wet and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast . This area is part of the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion . An irregular chain of mountains , hills , and plateaus known as the Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast - Cameroon 's highest point at 4,095 metres ( 13,435 ft ) - almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon 's northern tip . This region has a mild climate , particularly on the Western High Plateau , although rainfall is high . Its soils are among Cameroon 's most fertile , especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon . Volcanism here has created the crater lakes , like Lake Nyos of the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion . The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy , rugged Adamawa Plateau . This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country 's north and south . Its average elevation is 1,100 metres ( 3,609 ft ) , and its temperature ranges from 22 °C ( 71.6 °F ) to 25 °C ( 77 °F ) with high rainfall . The northern lowland region extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of 300 to 350 metres ( 984 to 1,148 ft ) . Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass . This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures",102.8,No
Nigeria,"Nigeria is covered by rainforests over the southern third , Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the middle third and both savannas and Sahel in the northern third . The mountain land is also found in the mountains near the Cameroonian border . The most southerly part of the forest , especially around the Niger River and Cross River deltas , is mangrove swamp ( see Central African mangroves ) . North of this is fresh water swamp , containing different vegetation from the salt water mangrove swamps , and north of that is rain forest",433.8,Sahel
Niger,Niger 's subtropical climate is mainly very hot and dry . Niger is located mostly in the Sahara desert save for a small piece of tropical savanna around the River Niger basin . Some flat to rolling savanna and Sahel land is in the southernmost fifth of its territory and in the northern hills,31.2,Sahel and CILLS
Burkina Faso,"A relatively dry tropical savanna , the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso , and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South . Situated at a middle latitude is the Sudan-Sahel region , a transitional zone for rainfall and temperature levels . Further to the south , the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than heavy rain each year and has cooler temperatures . The northern fringes of the country are beginning to become a desert",148.9,Sahel and CILLS
Côte d'Ivoire /Ivory Coast,"Côte d'Ivoire 's terrain can generally be described as a large plateau rising gradually from sea level in the south to almost 500 m elevation in the north . In the south of Côte d'Ivoire is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretch 300 km ( 186 mi ) along the eastern half of the coast . The south and southwest of the country are covered with dense tropical moist forest like the Eastern Guinean forests and Western Guinean lowland forests that cross the Sassandra River . The mountains of Dix-Huit Montagnes region are home to the Guinean montane forests . The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west . The North is part of the West Sudanian savanna , a savanna -and- scrubland zone of lateritic or sandy soils , with vegetation decreasing from south to north . The terrain is mostly flat to undulating plains , with mountains in the northwest . The climate of Côte d'Ivoire is generally warm and humid , ranging from equatorial in the southern coasts to tropical in the middle and semiarid in the far north . There are three seasons : warm and dry ( November to March ) , hot and dry ( March to May ) , and hot and wet ( June to October ) .

Algeria,"The coastal quarter has a Mediterranean climate , while the rest is either a sandy desert or semi-desert on the interior 's few hills . There is a strip of Sahel running through the far south and the climate is cooler in the mountain regions",37.1,Sahel
Mauritania,"Mauritania is located mostly in the Sahara desert save for a small piece of tropical savanna and Sahel around the River Senegal in approximately the southernmost quarter of its territory . Because of extended , severe drought , the desert has been expanding since the mid-1960s . To the west , between the ocean and the eastern plateaus , are alternating areas of clayey plains and sand dunes , some of which are shifted from place to place by high winds",8.2,"Sahel state , CILLS and Sénégal River Area"
Senegal,"Senegal has a both Sahel , Sahel-Soudan , Sudan_ ( region ) , Soudan-Guinea , tropical rainforest , and Guinean mangroves .

Guinea,"Guinea has both lowland belt running north to south behind the coast ( Lower Guinea ) , which is part of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion ; the pastoral Fouta Djallon highlands ( Middle Guinea ) ; the northern fertile ( Upper Guinea ) ; and a south-eastern rain-forest region ( Forest Guinea )",106.1,"Sahel state , CILLS and Sénégal River Area"
Guinea Bissau,"The climate in Guinea-Bissau is tropical and is generally hot and humid . It has a monsoonal-type rainy season with southwesterly winds and a dry season with northeasterly Harmattan winds . It is warm all year around and there is little temperature fluctuation ; it averages 26.3 °C ( 79.3 °F ) . The average rainfall for Bissau is 2,024 millimetres ( 79.7 in ) although this is almost entirely accounted for during the rainy season which falls between June and September/October . From December through April , the country experiences drought . The terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east",115.5,CILLS
