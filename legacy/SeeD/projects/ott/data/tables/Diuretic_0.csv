,Examples,Mechanism,Location ( numbered in distance along nephron )
-,"ethanol , water",Inhibits vasopressin secretion,
Acidifying salts,"calcium chloride , ammonium chloride",,1
Arginine vasopressin receptor 2 antagonists,"amphotericin B , lithium",Inhibits vasopressin 's action,5. collecting duct
Selective vasopressin V2 antagonist ( sometimes called aquaretics ),"tolvaptan , conivaptan","Competitive vasopressin antagonism leads to decreased number of aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the renal collecting ducts in kidneys , causing decreased water reabsorption . This causes an increase in renal free water excretion ( aquaresis ) , an increase in serum sodium concentration , a decrease in urine osmolality , and an increase in urine output",5. collecting duct
Na-H exchanger antagonists,dopamine,Promotes Na excretion,2. proximal tubule
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,"acetazolamide , dorzolamide","Inhibits H secretion , resultant promotion of Na and K excretion",2. proximal tubule
Loop diuretics,"bumetanide , ethacrynic acid , furosemide , torsemide",Inhibits the Na-K-2Cl symporter,3. medullary thick ascending limb
Osmotic diuretics,"glucose ( especially in uncontrolled diabetes ) , mannitol",Promotes osmotic diuresis,"2. proximal tubule , descending limb"
Potassium-sparing diuretics,"amiloride , spironolactone , eplerenone , triamterene , potassium canrenoate","Inhibition of Na+/K+ exchanger : Spironolactone inhibits aldosterone action , Amiloride inhibits epithelial sodium channels",5. cortical collecting ducts
Thiazides,"bendroflumethiazide , hydrochlorothiazide",Inhibits reabsorption by Na /Cl symporter,4. distal convoluted tubules
Xanthines,"caffeine , theophylline , theobromine","Inhibits reabsorption of Na , increase glomerular filtration rate",1. tubules
