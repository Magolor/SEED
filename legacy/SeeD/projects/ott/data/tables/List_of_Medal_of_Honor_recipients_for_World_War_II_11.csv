John D. Magrath †,Army,Private First Class,"near Castel d'Aiano , Italy","April 14 , 1945","His citation reads as follows : He displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty when his company was pinned down by heavy artillery , mortar , and small arms fire , near Castel d'Aiano , Italy . Volunteering to act as a scout , armed with only a rifle , he charged headlong into withering fire , killing 2 Germans and wounding 3 in order to capture a machinegun . Carrying this enemy weapon across an open field through heavy fire , he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests ; he then circled behind 4 other Germans , killing them with a burst as they were firing on his company . Spotting another dangerous enemy position to this right , he knelt with the machinegun in his arms and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 3 . The enemy now poured increased mortar and artillery fire on the company 's newly won position . Pfc . Magrath fearlessly volunteered again to brave the shelling in order to collect a report of casualties . Heroically carrying out this task , he made the supreme sacrifice -- a climax to the valor and courage that are in keeping with highest traditions of the military service"

Completely disregarding the great danger involved , he remained in his exposed position , and , with his M1 rifle , killed the enemy one by one until he was wounded four times . Taken to a covered position , he insisted on returning to a forward position to stand guard during the night . On the following morning the enemy launched a concerted attack and advanced to within a few yards of the position , throwing hand grenades as they approached . One of these landed within a few feet of Pfc . Mann . Unable to raise his arms , which were bandaged to his body , he yelled Grenade and threw his body over the grenade , and as it exploded , died . His outstanding gallantry above and beyond the call of duty and his magnificent conduct were an everlasting inspiration to his comrades for whom he gave his life"
