The Åland movement ( Ålandsrörelsen ) wanted Åland to reunite with its old mother country Sweden ( Finland and Åland belonged to Sweden before 1809 ) . The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the Åland Islands in 1917 ( that was about 96% of the population ) - they all supported a union with Sweden . When Finland became independent ( December 6 , 1917 ) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the Åland Islands to solve the problem . Finland refused and argued that the Åland Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule . Sweden appealed to the League of Nations referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to . After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the Åland Islands should be made an autonomous territory . The Swedish Prime Minister said he did n't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims"
