There really is n't a penalty for failure either psychologically or economically in the sense that , if you have a good idea and you go out to start your own company , even if you fail , you 're generally considered worth more to the company you left because you 've gained all this valuable experience , in many disciplines"
1982,,Academy of Achievement,Audio,"Money does not define success To be intelligent is to have a bird 's eye view of the city while others are navigating the streets below . The key to making connections that lead to innovation is to have a collection of out of the ordinary experiences to draw from . Bright people are corralled onto a beaten path . Consider alternative paths . Visit a third world country Fall in love with two people at once Walt Disney took LSD once and that 's where the idea for Fantasia came from . A variety of experiences will enable unique solutions . Do n't walk by a Zen Buddhist , buy him lunch . The people that run the world are n't that different from you The most ecstatic feeling is to give back to the pool of human innovation which we have all benefited from . You inherit the responsibility to be a guardian of the earth"
1983,"Aspen , Colorado",International Design Conference in Aspen ( IDCA ) - 'The Future Is n't What It Used To Be ' keynote,Audio ( Soundcloud ) Audio ( Archive.org ),"Computers are only 36 years old Kids growing up now will be part of the computer generation Computers are simple , adaptive , and fast The oldest person with a degree in Computer Science is 39 Computers are very fast . They run a million instructions per second Programmers build a collection of low level instructions into higher level instructions Early electric motors of the late 1890s initially were large thus were applied to large scale applications . They did n't proliferate quickly Later electric motors drove a shaft through a factory to empower multiple workstations simultaneously The fractional horsepower electric motor was a breakthrough because it was applied to small individual applications There are approximately 55 fractional horsepower motors in every household The history of computers parallels the history of electric motors ENIAC the first computer , was giant , hardly anyone got a chance to use it A 1960s computing breakthrough was Time-sharing . Many people could share a large computer e.g . on a college campus The reason Apple exists is because we stumbled on to the fractional horsepower computer 5 years before anybody else . We made a computer that was about 13 pounds The first PC was invented in 1976 . In 1983 the industry will ship 3 million personal computers By 1986 , we will ship more computers than automobiles in the USA ... I need your help . If you 've looked at computers , they all look like garbage . All of the great product designers are off designing automobiles/buildings but hardly any of them are designing computers . The industry will sell 10 million computers whether they look ugly or great because people are going to be spellbound/elated It does n't cost any more money to make it look great They are going to be these new objects that are going to be in everyone 's working environment , educational environment , and home environment We have a shot at putting a great object there ( work , school , home ) and if we do n't , we are going to put one more piece of junk object there By 1986 people will be spending two or three hours a day interacting with computers Industrial design , the software design should be given the same consideration that we give automobiles if not a lot more Most of the objects of our life are not designed in America . We 've blown it Computers and society are out on a first date in the 80s . We have a chance to make these things beautiful . We have a chance to communicate something through the design of the objects themselves . Apple alone will spend over 100 million dollars over the next 12 months on media advertising . IBM will spend at least that amount The personal computer is a new medium of communication . One of the media . e.g . books , radio , television , newspapers Computer communication is different from other mediums . Telephone demands both parties of a conversation be simultaneously present . Computers do not have this requirement . One of these days when we have portable computers with radio links , they can be walking around Aspen and retrieve it . ( e-mail ) The process of communication changes as the mediums evolve . When a new media emerges , we tend to fall back into old media habits The first TV shows are basically radio shows with a television camera pointed at them It took the better part of the 1950s for television to come 'into its own ' as a medium John F. Kennedy funeral television broadcast gave people a level of intensity that would not have been possible with radio The Apollo program landing . That experience was not possible with the previous medium It took 20 years for television to evolve away from radio Optical video discs ( Laserdisc ) can store 55 thousand images on a side , or an hour of video randomly accessible . What are we using it for ? Movies . We 're dropping back into old media habits . 5 to 10 years from now , random access storage will 'come into its own ' 1979 MIT experiment , Aspen Movie Map . A precursor of Google Street View is stored on laserdisc and reveals that random access storage will differentiate itself from other media We are still running historic applications on personal computers e.g . business accounting , COBOL Apple Lisa enables a person with little talent to draw artistic pictures , transmit them via e-mail Computer programs are an idea expressed on paper . They enable thousands of individual experiences based on one set of underlying principles Hamurabi video game . 7 year old kids are playing with a macro economic model . Interactive learning Books were a way to learn without an intermediary teacher . The problem was , you ca n't ask Aristotle a question . Maybe in the next 50 to 100 years we will enable computer to capture an individual 's underlying spirit , set of principles , world so that after they are gone we can ask the computer a question and receive an answer consistent with that individual Ultimately computers are going to be used for communication and over the next 5 years the standards for interconnecting computers are going to evolve . They all speak different languages right now . Early Xerox PARC Local Area Network list server revealed special interest groups in the office . Soon there were more interest groups than there were employees . As computers are networked ( on the internet ) , they will facilitate the creation of special interest groups and bring together the people in those groups . ( Social Networking ) Office Local Area Network are about 5 years away Home Local Area Network are about 10 to 15 years away We want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you , that you can learn how to use in 20 minutes . That 's what we want to do . And we want to do it this decade . And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so that you dont have to hook up to anything . So you are in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers . Apple sets out To design the computer that we want to put into the book eventually even though we can not put it into the book now and it 's called Lisa . Apple Lisa is sold out for the first year Eventually we will get to the point where people can create images as good as any other way"

Alexander Graham Bell Telegraph took 40 hours to learn Macintosh hardware took more than two years to design Good PR educates people Apple and IBM as computing standards Merging of the telephone and the personal computer Apple 's roots are selling to people not Fortune 500s Strategic mistakes of the Lisa computer division Jobs was inexperienced at running a company Sorrow over internal disagreements about the vision The Macintosh represents Jobs ' unrealized vision for the Lisa : a computer for people not corporations 'Insanely great ' people make 'insanely great ' products for themselves , to their own highest standard The Macintosh group wanted to build the greatest computer that has ever been seen The IBM PC group lacked pride in their product and were motivated by money Average age of Apple employees is 29 Most people in their 30s and 40s get stuck in their thought processes with rare exceptions Companies , as they grow to become multibillion-dollar entities , somehow lose their vision . They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work . Apple is an Ellis Island company . Apple is built on refugees from other companies . These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies . Dr. Edwin Land ( founder of Polaroid ) saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that ... Dr. Land one of those brilliant troublemakers , was asked to leave his own company - - which is one of the dumbest things Ive ever heard of . A visionary that brings together art and science is the most important thing to be , not a football player or astronaut In 5 to 10 years John Sculley and Jobs intend to make Apple a 10 or 20 billion dollar company That scale is merely to remain competitive . The bigger concern is how that scale is achieved . Apple hires people that want to make large contributions today not await permission to do so years from now . People/workers rarely get to contribute to the pool of innovation which we all rely upon . Rather than focus on Fortune 500 customers , focus on how to change how small groups/businesses work . There should not be one computing standard . Macintosh is clearly better than IBM . Innovation emerges via competition . IBM will eventually crush companies that are compatible with their systems To reach tens of millions of people , a computer that is significantly different from IBM is needed . Hence Macintosh . IBM believes in service , support , security , mainframes , and 'motherhood ' . Apples key observation three years ago was that when youre shipping 10,000,000 computers a year , even IBM does not have enough mothers to ship one with every computer . So youve got to build motherhood into the computer . If Apple makes a mistake and IBM wins , the world will enter a computer Dark Ages for 20 years . Frito-Lay , a company that dominates a market via service and support and stifles newcomers in their market . IBM dominated and therefore did not innovate in the mainframe industry for 15 years . The IBM platform is a repackaging of dated Apple II level technology Apple and IBM wo n't have much competition in the hardware space . The days of significant hardware start-ups are gone . New , innovative companies will focus on software"
