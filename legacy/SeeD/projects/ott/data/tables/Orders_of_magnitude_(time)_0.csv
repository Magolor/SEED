10,1 Planck time,t P,Presumed to be the shortest theoretically measurable time interval ( but not necessarily the shortest increment of time - see quantum gravity ),10 ys : One Planck time t P = ℏ G / c 5 { \displaystyle { \sqrt { \hbar G/c^ { 5 } } } } ≈ 5.39 × 10 s is the briefest physically meaningful span of time . It is the unit of time in the natural units system known as Planck units
10,1 yoctosecond,ys,"Yoctosecond , ( yocto- + second ) , is one septillionth of a second",0.3 ys : mean lifetime of W and Z bosons 23 ys : Lifespan isotope 7 of hydrogen ( Hydrogen-7 ) 156 ys : mean lifetime of a Higgs Boson
10,1 zeptosecond,zs,"Zeptosecond , ( zepto- + second ) , is one sextillionth of one second",2 zs : representative cycle time of gamma ray radiation released in the decay of a radioactive atomic nucleus ( here as 2 MeV per emitted photon ) 4 zs : cycle time of the zitterbewegung of an electron ( ω = 2 m e c 2 / ℏ { \displaystyle \omega =2m_ { e } c^ { 2 } /\hbar } )
10,1 attosecond,as,One quintillionth of one second,12 attoseconds : best timing control of laser pulses
