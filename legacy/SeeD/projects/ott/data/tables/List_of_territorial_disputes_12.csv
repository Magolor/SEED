By a 4 to 2 vote , the final resolution favored the American position . Canada did not get an outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea .

New Hampshire Grants / Vermont,New Hampshire/New York/Vermont,1749,1791,"In 1664 King Charles II decided the west bank of the Connecticut River was the eastern boundary of New York , so that that province included all of what later became the state of Vermont . During 1749-64 , Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred grants , offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont . In 1764 , King George III attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York . But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth 's grants , so local governments and militias resisted New York 's rule . In 1777 , the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York , Britain , and New Hampshire , calling it the State of Vermont . Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country , considered by New York to be a district in rebellion .
