Location,Approx . longitude,Approx . latitude of tree line,Notes
Norway,24°E,70°N,The North Atlantic current makes Arctic climates in this region warmer than other coastal locations at comparable latitude . In particular the mildness of winters prevents permafrost
West Siberian Plain,75°E,66°N,
Central Siberian Plateau,102°E,72°N,"Extreme continental climate means the summer is warm enough to allow tree growth at higher latitudes , extending to northernmost forests of the world at 72°28 ' N at Ary-Mas ( 102° 15 ' E ) in the Novaya River valley , a tributary of the Khatanga River and the more northern Lukunsky grove at 72°31 ' N , 105° 03 ' E east from Khatanga River"
Russian Far East ( Kamchatka and Chukotka ),160°E,60°N,The Oyashio Current and strong winds affect summer temperatures to prevent tree growth . The Aleutian Islands are almost completely treeless
Alaska,152°W,68°N,Trees grow north to the south-facing slopes of the Brooks Range . The mountains block cold air coming off of the Arctic Ocean
"Northwest Territories , Canada",132°W,69°N,Reaches north of the Arctic Circle because of the continental nature of the climate and warmer summer temperatures
Nunavut,95°W,61°N,Influence of the very cold Hudson Bay moves the treeline southwards
Labrador Peninsula,72°W,56°N,"Very strong influence of the Labrador Current on summer temperatures as well as altitude effects ( much of Labrador is a plateau ) . In parts of Labrador , the treeline extends as far south as 53°N . Along the coast the northernmost trees are at 58°N in Napartok Bay"
Greenland,50°W,64°N,"Determined by experimental tree planting in the absence of native trees because of isolation from natural seed sources ; a very few trees are surviving , but growing slowly , at Søndre Strømfjord , 67°N . There is one natural forest in the Qinngua Valley"
